<!-- 	DISCLAIMER: AI was used for debugging this. After I had created the entire code and had everything as I wanted it except for 
	constant flickering from some elements, I consulted AI. AI pointed out a few instances of random() being used still where I thought
	that I had stored things to variables and replaced those when redesigning from v1, as well as the fact that I forgot to floor() boatX,
	which solved these problems. Beyond this, no AI was used. All code was //written by me//, using the p5js references as support. 

	Once again, I am already on v2. My first version did not have the boat and still had flickering, but 
	I was not happy with it even as a first draft.

	Artist statement: 
 	I have had the idea in my head for a long time of a civilization that lives in the rock faces of some canyon or ravine, to the point
  it would be difficult to identify any particular inspirations. For this particular realization of that idea, I started simple: orange is
  my favorite color, and I love orangeish rock formations like those of the Grand Canyon, so it started with just a simple orange gradient
	of mountains. Then I noticed the liquid noise example in p5js and immediately decided that I needed to include that too, so I put that into
  the foreground. From there I had to pick and choose the simplest ways of showing that humans lived in the cliffs. In my imagination of this civilization,
  they have an extensive system of scaffolding and paths carved into the cliffside, they hang long colorful strings of banners in the breeze accompanied
	by dangling silver, they paint murals on the cliffsides, and more. Most of that was too complicated for this project, so I started out with some windows/
	doors into the cliffside to imply the buildings within. At first they were dark, but I realized that having them yellow to represent lights
	gave a clearer image (more like what you'd expect from a city) and had the added bonus of changing when they flooded to add an organic and dynamic feel.
	While strings of banners seemed like a bit much for now, flags are easy, so I added those, and having the colors be consist implies some
	real cultural structure to my civilization (after all, understanding color symbolism to the point of having national colors shows focus beyond
	just survival). And finally, to give a sense of journeying through this land and to give the viewer something to focus on, I added the boat
	sailing across the screen and onto new lands. Overall, the landscape is simply supposed to be a peaceful journey through my made-up
	civilization.
